# NOTICE:
# For some unknown reason, even though lf is launched in gitbash
# and the 'set shell zsh/bash' is called. The previewer will only
# find lf_preview.bat file 😅
# Fortunatelly there is fzf-preview.ps1 for powershell, so it is easier
# to use that one instead.

# This is the price for getting a nicer preview...
