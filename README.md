Scripts and Utilities
===========

This repository is a collection of many utitlity scripts on different languages and for different platforms.

# Motivation

Centralize many scripts I've written (and continue to write). Some of them have comments of previous implementations
or references to where the information was taken to build said script.

The scripts here do not follow "best practices" or naming conventions, rather the focus is in making the scripts "work"
and serve as example on how to achive specific tasks. You probably can and should make them better.

# Shell Scripts

Most shell scripts have a Bash and Powershell equivalent versions (when they make sense).

# About package manager directories

The purpose of these directories is to store the list of packages installed with them so it is easier to reinstall later.
Some may have additional config files to serve as an example.

# About the /bin directory

The purpose of `/bin` is to be located as the last entry in the `PATH` and have scripts with relatively long names
that should prevent conflicts with other utilities from your native OS. The `path_end` is an empty script that
can be used for this purpose by running it and check for exit status or simply looking if it is available in the path.

# Contributing

Feel free to contribute any of your scripts or submit patches to fix any issue you encounter.
Also feel free to ask questions if you wonder about something you see in any of them.
